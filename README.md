# Robeth's Borderlands Unlimited COOP Mod
A tool to patch Borderlands 2 to support 5+ players in game

The patcher might act like it's frozen after you press the patch button, but it's just making a copy of your entire Borderlands 2 folder for safety. The tool will place a patched verion of Borderlands 2 on your desktop that you need to run to use my COOP mod. To execute the COOP patch in game, press '~' and type exec cooppatch.txt.
